# ParallelSortSofiya
parallel sort library + execution demo
This is a project that consists of parallel static library, written in C, and a test executable file ParSortExe.exe. The library includes three parallel functions for sorting different number of integers in an ascending order. 
The test file is placed in the main Debug folder and when starting it you need to enter number of elements to be sorted, as well as algorithm number(1,2 or 3) to be used for sorting them.
Detailed information about the function you can find in the documentation (which is still in preparations).
